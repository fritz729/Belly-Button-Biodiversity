# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview
This project was targeted at creating an interactive webpage that allowed users to select individual data from a study of the microbiome diversity observed in the belly buttons of a number of subjects that took part in the study. With the sample ID selected the user can observe graphs created of the data collected from the subject. The link to the webpage is seen below.  



## Results

The project was divided into 3 tasks.  The initial task was to plan the webpage using a storyboard that shows the page layout and the information that will be contained in the webpage. Second, was to develop the functionality of the webpage to product the graphs and visuals that would be viewed on the webpage. Finally, the webpage was customized to improve the visual aesthetics and overall style of the webpage




## Summary

By creating an interactive webpage, it allows the user to view the data in unique ways that makes the interaction more dynamic and interesting for the user.  To display all the charts for the data collecting would be hard to visualize cleanly and would make it difficult for users to navigate the information.  The use of JavaScript with HTML code show the diversity that can be used to display and interact with users to present data in a clean and meaningful way.
